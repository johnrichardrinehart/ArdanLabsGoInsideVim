# What

This repository was created to support an internal presentation of configuring
[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) as an IDE for use with the [Go programming
language](https://go.dev/).

# When

24-FEB-2022

# Where

In a company-organized call.

# Who

Anyone working for Ardan Labs (and maybe some outside guests) who wanted to
attend.

# Why

Vim is present in most programming environments. If it's not immediately
available it's usually trivial to install it. Configuration is the challenging
part. Stock Vim comes with scant features that facilitate any particular
development environment. This presentation should provide a good motivation for
a sane Vim configuration that Go developers can source as an everyday driver or
in an "emergency" situation to be productive in a foreign development
environment.
